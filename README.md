## Project Overview

Dr-ML is a multi-disease prediction system designed using a scalable and modular architecture. It includes separate machine learning pipelines for Heart Disease and Diabetes prediction while sharing a common backend API. The application provides an interactive Streamlit interface where users can enter patient information and receive real-time predictions with probability scores. The FastAPI backend is deployed on Render, and the frontend is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated during experimentation, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost 

The best-performing models were selected using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning before deployment.


## Deployment

### Backend

- FastAPI
- Render

### Frontend

- Streamlit
- Streamlit Community Cloud

The frontend communicates with the deployed FastAPI backend through REST APIs to provide real-time disease predictions.
